  /* The actual 'width' and 'height' attributes (drawing surface) of the canvas 
    are set by JavaScript to canvasWidth/canvasHeight (e.g., WORLD_PIXEL_WIDTH).
    The CSS 'width' and 'height' (visual size of the element) are also set by 
    inline styles in MapCanvas.tsx to match these drawing surface dimensions.
    This makes the canvas element itself as large as the scrollable world.
    The parent div (.map-scrollable-content in Explore.tsx/Sunnybrook.tsx) 
    is then scrolled by the .explore-page or .sunnybrook-page.
