    The canvas width and height are set via inline styles in MapCanvas.tsx
    to match the full dimensions of the map data (e.g., WORLD_PIXEL_WIDTH).
    It's a child of .map-scrollable-content, which is a child of .explore-page.
    .explore-page has overflow: auto.
    The <main> tag in App.tsx has overflow: hidden.
    This layering should, in theory, prevent the canvas from interfering
    with fixed elements like the NavBar, but complex interactions can occur.
